      distinct IG/TR loci. `*_head-head` refers to techniques that link the 5' ends
      of transcripts in a single-cell context. `*_tail-head` refers to techniques
      that link the 3' end of one transcript to the 5' end of another one in a single-cell
      context. This term does not provide any information whether a continuous reading-frame
      between the two is generated. `*_prelinked` refers to constructs in which the
      linkage was already present on the DNA level (e.g. scFv).
