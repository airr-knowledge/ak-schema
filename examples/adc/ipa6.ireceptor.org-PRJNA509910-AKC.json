Following reverse transcription and cell barcoding in droplets, emulsions were broken and cDNA purified using Dynabeads MyOne SILANE followed by PCR amplification (98 °C for 45 s; 13–18 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 67 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 1 min). Amplified cDNA was then used for both 5′ gene expression library construction and TCR enrichment. For gene expression library construction, 2.4–50 ng of amplified cDNA was fragmented and end-repaired, double-sided size-selected with SPRIselect beads, PCR-amplified with sample indexing primers (98 °C for 45 s; 14–16 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 54 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 20 s; 72 °C for 1 min), and double-sided size-selected with SPRIselect beads. For TCR library construction, TCR transcripts were enriched from 2 μl of amplified cDNA by PCR (primer sets 1 and 2: 98 °C for 45 s; 10 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 67 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 1 min). Following TCR enrichment, 5–50 ng of enriched PCR product was fragmented and end-repaired, size-selected with SPRIselect beads, PCR-amplified with sample-indexing primers (98 °C for 45 s; 9 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 54 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 20 s; 72 °C for 1 min), and sizeselected with SPRIselect beads."
