        "description": "CD4+ T cells reactive against SARS-CoV-2 can be found in unexposed individuals, and these are suggested to arise in response to common cold coronavirus (CCCoV) infection. Here, we utilized SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cell enrichment to examine the antigen avidity and clonality of these cells, as well as the relative contribution of CCCoV cross-reactivity. SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ memory T cells were present in virtually all unexposed individuals examined, displaying low functional avidity and multiple, highly variable cross-reactivities that were not restricted to CCCoVs. SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells from COVID-19 patients lacked cross-reactivity to CCCoVs, irrespective of strong memory T cell responses against CCCoV in all donors analyzed. In severe but not mild COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed low functional avidity and clonality, despite increased frequencies. Our findings identify low-avidity CD4+ T cell responses as a hallmark of severe COVID-19 and argue against a protective role for CCCoV-reactive T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n",

Sorted CD154+ T cells were removed from the sorting chamber into pre-coated low-bind collection tubes, 1ml RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 5% AB Serum was added, and cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 400 x g, 4°C. The supernatant was removed leaving 10-30 μL to reach a maximum concentration of 1000 cells /μl. Single-cell suspensions were loaded on a Chromium Chip G (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for processing with the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5' Library and Gel Bead Kit v1.1. Depending on the number of cells available for each patient, a maximum of 30,000 cells were loaded for each reaction.
