    range: PCRTarget

  complete_sequences:
    description: To be considered `complete`, the procedure used for library construction MUST generate sequences that 1) include the first V gene codon that encodes the mature polypeptide chain (i.e. after the leader sequence) and 2) include the last complete codon of the J gene (i.e. 1 bp 5' of the J->C splice site) and 3) provide sequence information for all positions between 1) and 2). To be considered `complete & untemplated`, the sections of the sequences defined in points 1) to 3) of the previous sentence MUST be untemplated, i.e. MUST NOT overlap with the primers used in library preparation. `mixed` should only be used if the procedure used for library construction will likely produce multiple categories of sequences in the given experiment. It SHOULD NOT be used as a replacement of a NULL value.
    # TODO: enum
  physical_linkage:
    description: In case an experimental setup is used that physically links nucleic acids derived from distinct `Rearrangements` before library preparation, this field describes the mode of that linkage. All `hetero_*` terms indicate that in case of paired-read sequencing, the two reads should be expected to map to distinct IG/TR loci. `*_head-head` refers to techniques that link the 5' ends of transcripts in a single-cell context. `*_tail-head` refers to techniques that link the 3' end of one transcript to the 5' end of another one in a single-cell context. This term does not provide any information whether a continuous reading-frame between the two is generated. `*_prelinked` refers to constructs in which the linkage was already present on the DNA level (e.g. scFv).
