This term does not provide any information whether a continuous reading-frame between the two is generated. `*_prelinked` refers to constructs in which the linkage was already present on the DNA level (e.g. scFv).

    name: rearrangement__complete_vdj
    description: True if the sequence alignment spans the entire V(D)J region. Meaning, sequence_alignment includes both the first V gene codon that encodes the mature polypeptide chain (i.e., after the leader sequence) and the last complete codon of the J gene (i.e., before the J-C splice site). This does not require an absence of deletions within the internal FWR and CDR regions of the alignment.
