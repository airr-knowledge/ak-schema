slots:
  tissue_processing:
    name: tissue_processing
    description: Enzymatic digestion and/or physical methods used to isolate cells from sample
    range: string
    required: True
    nullable: True

  cell_subset:
    name: cell_subset
    description: Commonly-used designation of isolated cell population
    range: CellSubset
    required: True
    nullable: True

  cell_phenotype:
    name: cell_phenotype
    description: List of cellular markers and their expression levels used to isolate the cell population
    range: string
    required: True
    nullable: True

  cell_species:
    name: cell_species
    description: Binomial designation of the species from which the analyzed cells originate. Typically, this value should be identical to `species`, in which case it SHOULD NOT be set explicitly. However, there are valid experimental setups in which the two might differ, e.g., chimeric animal models. If set, this key will overwrite the `species` information for all lower layers of the schema.
    range: CellSpecies
    required: False
    nullable: True

  single_cell:
    name: single_cell
    description: TRUE if single cells were isolated into separate compartments
    range: boolean
    required: True
    nullable: True

  cell_number:
    name: cell_number
    description: Total number of cells that went into the experiment
    range: integer
    required: True
    nullable: True

  cells_per_reaction:
    name: cells_per_reaction
    description: Number of cells for each biological replicate
    range: integer
    required: True
    nullable: True

  cell_storage:
    name: cell_storage
    description: TRUE if cells were cryo-preserved between isolation and further processing
    range: boolean
    required: True
    nullable: True

  cell_quality:
    name: cell_quality
    description: Relative amount of viable cells after preparation and (if applicable) thawing
    range: string
    required: True
    nullable: True

  cell_isolation:
    name: cell_isolation
    description: Description of the procedure used for marker-based isolation or enrich cells
    range: string
    required: True
    nullable: True

  cell_processing_protocol:
    name: cell_processing_protocol
    description: Description of the methods applied to the sample including cell preparation/ isolation/enrichment and nucleic acid extraction. This should closely mirror the Materials and methods section in the manuscript.
    range: string
    required: True
    nullable: True
