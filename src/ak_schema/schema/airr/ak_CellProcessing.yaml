    description: Commonly-used designation of isolated cell population
    range: CellSubset
    required: true

    name: cell_phenotype
    description: List of cellular markers and their expression levels used to isolate the cell population
    range: string
    required: true
    annotations:
      nullable: true
  cell_species:
    name: cell_species
    description: Binomial designation of the species from which the analyzed cells originate. Typically, this value should be identical to `species`, in which case it SHOULD NOT be set explicitly. However, there are valid experimental setups in which the two might differ, e.g., chimeric animal models. If set, this key will overwrite the `species` information for all lower layers of the schema.
