cell_species:
    name: cell_species
    description: Binomial designation of the species from which the analyzed cells originate. Typically, this value should be identical to `species`, in which case it SHOULD NOT be set explicitly. However, there are valid experimental setups in which the two might differ, e.g., chimeric animal models. If set, this key will overwrite the `species` information for all lower layers of the schema.
