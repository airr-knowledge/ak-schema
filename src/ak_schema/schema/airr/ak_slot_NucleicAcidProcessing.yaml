template_class:
  name: template_class
  description: The class of nucleic acid that was used as primary starting material for the following procedures
  range: TemplateClass

template_quality:
  name: template_quality
  description: Description and results of the quality control performed on the template material
  range: string

template_amount:
  name: template_amount
  description: Amount of template that went into the process
  range: number

template_amount_unit:
  name: template_amount_unit
  description: Unit of template amount
  range: TemplateAmountUnit

library_generation_method:
  name: library_generation_method
  description: Generic type of library generation
  range: LibraryGenerationMethod

library_generation_protocol:
  name: library_generation_protocol
  description: Description of processes applied to substrate to obtain a library that is ready for sequencing
  range: string

library_generation_kit_version:
  name: library_generation_kit_version
  description: When using a library generation protocol from a commercial provider, provide the protocol version number
  range: string

pcr_target:
  name: pcr_target
  description: If a PCR step was performed that specifically targets the IG/TR loci, the target and primer locations need to be provided here. This field holds an array of PCRTarget objects, so that multiplex PCR setups amplifying multiple loci at the same time can be annotated using one record per locus. PCR setups not targeting any specific locus must not annotate this field but select the appropriate library_generation_method instead.
  range: PCRTarget
  multivalued: true

complete_sequences:
  name: complete_sequences
  description: To be considered `complete`, the procedure used for library construction MUST generate sequences that 1) include the first V gene codon that encodes the mature polypeptide chain (i.e. after the leader sequence) and 2) include the last complete codon of the J gene (i.e. 1 bp 5' of the J->C splice site) and 3) provide sequence information for all positions between 1) and 2). To be considered `complete & untemplated`, the sections of the sequences defined in points 1) to 3) of the previous sentence MUST be untemplated, i.e. MUST NOT overlap with the primers used in library preparation. `mixed` should only be used if the procedure used for library construction will likely produce multiple categories of sequences in the given experiment. It SHOULD NOT be used as a replacement of a NULL value.
  range: CompleteSequences

physical_linkage:
  name: physical_linkage
  description: In case an experimental setup is used that physically links nucleic acids derived from distinct `Rearrangements` before library preparation, this field describes the mode of that linkage. All `hetero_*` terms indicate that in case of paired-read sequencing, the two reads should be expected to map to distinct IG/TR loci. `*_head-head` refers to techniques that link the 5' ends of transcripts in a single-cell context. `*_tail-head` refers to techniques that link the 3' end of one transcript to the 5' end of another one in a single-cell context. This term does not provide any information whether a continuous reading-frame between the two is generated. `*_prelinked` refers to constructs in which the linkage was already present on the DNA level (e.g. scFv).
  range: PhysicalLinkage
