slots:
  subject_id:
    name: subject_id
    description: Subject ID assigned by submitter, unique within study. If possible, a persistent subject ID linked to an INSDC or similar repository study should be used.
    range: string
    required: True
    nullable: True
    identifier: True

  synthetic:
    name: synthetic
    description: TRUE for libraries in which the diversity has been synthetically generated (e.g. phage display)
    range: boolean
    required: True
    nullable: False

  species:
    name: species
    description: Binomial designation of subject's species

    required: True
    nullable: False

  organism:
    name: organism
    description: Binomial designation of subject's species
    range: ontology
    required: False
    nullable: True

  sex:
    name: sex
    description: Biological sex of subject
    range: Sex
    required: True
    nullable: True

  age_min:
    name: age_min
    description: Specific age or lower boundary of age range.
    range: number
    required: True
    nullable: True

  age_max:
    name: age_max
    description: Upper boundary of age range or equal to age_min for specific age. This field should only be null if age_min is null.

  age_event:
    name: age_event
    description: Event in the study schedule to which `Age` refers. For NCBI BioSample this MUST be `sampling`. For other implementations submitters need to be aware that there is currently no mechanism to encode to potential delta between `Age event` and `Sample collection time`, hence the chosen events should be in temporal proximity.
