slots:
  sequence_id:
    name: sequence_id
    description: Unique query sequence identifier for the Rearrangement. Most often this will be the input sequence header or a substring thereof, but may also be a custom identifier defined by the tool in cases where query sequences have been combined in some fashion prior to alignment. When downloaded from an AIRR Data Commons repository, this will usually be a universally unique record locator for linking with other objects in the AIRR Data Model.
    range: string
    required: True
    nullable: True
    identifier: True

  sequence:
    name: sequence
    description: The query nucleotide sequence. Usually, this is the unmodified input sequence, which may be reverse complemented if necessary. In some cases, this field may contain consensus sequences or other types of collapsed input sequences if these steps are performed prior to alignment.

    required: True
    nullable: True
