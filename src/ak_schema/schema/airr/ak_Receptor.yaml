slots:
  receptor_id:
    name: receptor_id
    description: ID of the current Receptor object, unique within the local repository.
    range: string
    required: true
    annotations: true
  receptor_hash:
    name: receptor_hash
    description: The SHA256 hash of the receptor amino acid sequence, calculated on the concatenated ``receptor_variable_domain_*_aa`` sequences and represented as base16-encoded string.
    range: string
    required: true
    annotations:
      nullable: false
  receptor_type:
    name: receptor_type
    description: The top-level receptor type, either Immunoglobulin (Ig) or T Cell Receptor (TCR).
    range: string
    required: true
    annotations:
      nullable: false
  receptor_variable_domain_1_aa:
    name: receptor_variable_domain_1_aa
    description: Complete amino acid sequence of the mature variable domain of the Ig heavy, TCR beta or TCR delta chain. The mature variable domain is defined as encompassing all AA from and including first AA after the the signal peptide to and including the last AA that is completely encoded by the J gene.

    annotations:
      nullable: false
  receptor_variable_domain_1_locus:
    name: receptor_variable_domain_1_locus
    description: Locus from which the variable domain in receptor_variable_domain_1_aa originates
    range: string
    required: true
    annotations:
      nullable: false
  receptor_variable_domain_2_aa:
    name: receptor_variable_domain_2_aa
    description: Complete amino acid sequence of the mature variable domain of the Ig light, TCR alpha or TCR gamma chain. The mature variable domain is defined as encompassing all AA from and including first AA after the the signal peptide to and including the last AA that is completely encoded by the J gene.
    range: string
    required: true
    annotations:
      nullable: false
